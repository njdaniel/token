JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Great mechanism to authenicate users. Once user authenicates with login(username, password) they will be given a jwt that contains info on the user and what they can access. This will replace using username/password for each request.

JWT can be stored on the webstorage(localstorage/sessionstorage) or cookie.
